# [Joy Machine](https://joy-machine.com/) - Repo of *Things*
### Currently Being Developed Alongside [*Steel Hunters*](https://joy-machine.com/steel-hunters)
This is Joy Machine's public repository of everything that we can easily separate from our main engine and game source base that we think is useful for people. There are some proprietary things we'd adore to include as well, but alas, we have to have some secrets.

We're adding to this pretty regularly, so check in every now and then to see what's new. And, of course, if there is anything in particular that you're looking for, just put up an Issue in the repo and we'll see what we can do. Or we'll shoot your idea down instantly and viciously.

Most recent change log (which is poorly-updated until we finally find a good generator): [CHANGELOG.md](https://github.com/joymachinegames/joymachine-public/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md).

* [**`git`**](https://github.com/joymachinegames/joymachine-public/tree/master/git) -- Some git configurations for ignoring files, LFS-managed files, and then detailed config settings for everyday interaction with git on the command line.
* [**`joy-create` (wip)**](https://github.com/joymachinegames/joymachine-public/tree/feature/joy-create-v0.1/joy-create) â€” This is a work-in-progress Electron application (eventually a general web app as well) for using [l-systems/turtle instantiation](https://cgjennings.ca/articles/l-systems.html) of shapes/meshes to create exportable OBJ/FBXs out of the results. As noted: *very work-in-progress*.
* [**`scripts`**](https://github.com/joymachinegames/joymachine-public/tree/master/scripts) -- Miscellaneous scripts (tools, powershell, visual studio extensions, batch files, etc.) 
* [**`ue4-source`**](https://github.com/joymachinegames/joymachine-public/tree/master/ue4-source) -- Whatever C++ actors/components/utilities/etc. we end up being able to easily divorce from our projects. Or, if not easily divorced, whatever seems worth divorcing so others never have to know the pain that we did. This will likely be the least frequently-updated part of the repo.
   * **NOTE**: The source is kind of a free-for-all; I infrequently add some of the more generic/widely-useful stuff I can, but I can't include the full source integrations (such as, in the case of the anamorphic lens flares, the updated `Scene.h`|`.cpp` nor `PostProcessing.cpp`) due to a whole lot of custom work done.
   * The anamorphic lens flare code is also a very rough first-draft.
   * The object pooling code is _not_ ready for production use by any means at the moment; it looked like it would be lovely and fine, but it is not. It is a wolf dressed up as a friendly grandmother and it will eat all joy from you.
* [**`ue4`**](https://github.com/joymachinegames/joymachine-public/tree/master/ue4) -- Our general-purpose Unreal Engine 4 stockpile. Contains our team production conventions and, more interestingly at the moment, a variety of material functions and our "standard shader set" (they're just materials, but I call them shaders because they're pretty... intense).
   * **NOTE**: These assets are output from Unreal Engine 4.19; there are archived versions of them (without the changes) for 4.17 in the `4.17` subfolder.

### Other Things of Note:
* [**RESEARCH PAPERS**](https://github.com/joymachinegames/joymachine-public/blob/master/RESEARCH_PAPERS.md) - For the nerdier among us (like me), here are some of the better research papers/presentations I've come across over the years. That have survived over time.
* [**RESOURCES**](https://github.com/joymachinegames/joymachine-public/blob/master/RESOURCES.md) -- A list of general resources for game development across a number of disciplines. (Work-in-Progress at the moment)
* [**AWESOME_SOFTWARE**](https://github.com/joymachinegames/joymachine-public/blob/master/AWESOME_SOFTWARE.md) -- Has a list of all of the software that I (trent) have found to be the best solution within its given context.
* [**AWESOME_GAMEDEV_MENTORS**](https://ishansharma.github.io/twitter-mentors/) -- Technically, it's "twitter-mentors", but I like my name better. Anyway, this is [@ishansharma](https://github.com/ishansharma)'s compilation of people ([@trentpolack](https://github.com/trentpolack) included) who offer game development mentoring to anyone that seeks it.
* [**Unreal Engine 4 - General Information**](https://github.com/joymachinegames/joymachine-public/blob/master/ue4/README.md) -- A collection of information, links, and whatever else seems helpful to include. It also contains a summary of the UE4 content contained therein.
* [**Unreal Engine 4 - Joy Machine Conventions**](https://github.com/joymachinegames/joymachine-public/blob/master/ue4/CONVENTIONS.md) -- Our internal development conventions for working with UE4.
