# [Joy Machine](http://joy-machine.com/) - Public
Random Joy Machine tools, documents, mini-projects, and whatever that we want to be public. We're adding to this pretty regularly, so check in every now and then to see what's new.

Most recent change log: [CHANGELOG.md](https://github.com/joymachinegames/joymachine-public/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md).

* `git-template` - Some git configurations for ignoring files, LFS-managed files, and then some useful config settings.
* `joy-create` - This is mega early in development (like, two days old), but it's eventually going to be a standalone L-system turtle-based procedural mesh generation system. You'll be able to instantiate any mesh you want using a series of grammars to dictate the progression of the generation, then export the resulting mesh.
* `powershell` - I (trent) use Powershell almost exclusively, so I made some littles scripts as well as some shortcuts I dig.
* `tools` - At the moment, this just contains our batch script for taking megascans output and assembling it into our texture use conventions (three channel-packed textures: albedo (RGB)/displacement (A), metal (R)/roughness (G)/cavity (B)/AO (A), and normal map).
* `ue4` - Our general-purpose Unreal Engine 4 stockpile. Contains our team production conventions and, more interestingly at the moment, a variety of material functions and our "standard shader set" (they're just materials, but I call them shaders because they're pretty... intense). 

More will be added soon!

hugs,
Joy Machine
