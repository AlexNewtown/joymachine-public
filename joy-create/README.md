# Joy Create

## Current Status
In active development as of May 2017.

## Building
 1. Clone the parent repository to disk.
 2. `cd joy-create`
 3. `npm install` installs the node modules required for this app to build, including electron itself.
 4. `npm start` uses the electron module to launch this app.

For now, we don't package the dependent `node_modules` so they are ignored.
