# Joy Create

## Building
 0. Clone the parent repository to disk.
 1. `cd joy-create`
 2. `npm install` installs the node modules required for this app to build, including electron itself.
 3. `npm start` uses the electron module to launch this app.

For now, we don't package the dependent `node_modules` so they are ignored.
