# Joy Create
The goal of this side-project of mine (hi, it's trent) is to be as simple a grammar-based procedural generation-through-mesh/shape-instancing + l-systems/turtle-placement as... Well. As simple as that hard thing can get. It will be a cross-platform (and web, most likely) electron app with a viewport on one side and a code editor on the right. Make changes, update viewport, see changes, make changes, so on and so forth.

It's purely a concept at this point in time, though. I've been playing around with it as time allows, but time stopped allowing anything for a while.

## Current Status
In desired-but-mostly-stuck development as of October 2017. It's also mostly being developed in the the [**feature/joy-create-v0.1**](https://github.com/joymachinegames/joymachine-public/tree/feature/joy-create-v0.1) branch.
